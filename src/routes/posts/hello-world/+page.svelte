<h1>Hello World!</h1>
<h3>
  Welcome to my personal blog. It's very very bare bones at the moment, but I'm
  hoping the embarassment of having it public is gonna force me to put some work
  into learning frontend tools. Cause I don't want <i>this</i> to be up visible for
  too long.

<h2>Who am I even?</h2>
<h3>
  That's kinda rude, but ok. <br />
  I'm just a persont that's passionate about programming and a lot of tech topics,
  and been that way since early childhood. I like talking about the things I'm passionate
  about, and so I thought of using this site as a place to do that instead of scattering
  it across various social media I use.

  <!--   <li>Neovim</li> -->
  <!--   <li>Compiler development, or my attempts at it</li> -->
  <!--   <li>Attempts at turning python into a more type safe language</li> -->
  <!--   <li>Anything I've been working on recently</li> -->

  Well, hopefully there's going to be more, since as I said before, this looks
  hideous. But I want to get this post out as a kind of a mission statemnt and a
  todo list for myself. In the following posts I plan on talkning about the
  development process of the website. You can check the website source code at
  <a href="https://github.com/ehllie/blog"> my github page.</a> <br />

  That's it for now, looking forward to seeing you later!<br />
